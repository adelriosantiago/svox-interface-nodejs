# svox-interface-nodejs

With this Node.js web interface you can generate WAV files directly from the SVOX speech engine.

Obviously the voice is not exactly the *most natural voice ever*, however I think that SVOX pronunciation is far superior than other TTS's out there like Festival and eSpeak.

Play and generate some words with the demo at: [tts.adelriosantiago.com](http://tts.adelriosantiago.com)

##### Running your own server requires:

 - A linux machine or any unix architechture capable of running the SVOX engine.
 Tested on:
  - Ubuntu 12.04
  - Ubuntu 12.10
 - Node.js
 - The *pico2wave* package
